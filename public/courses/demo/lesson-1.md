# One‑Screen Learning with an AI Coach

**Goal:** Experience a calm, accessible lesson flow with an AI coach grounded in this page.

**DO** — Read this short lesson and try the practice checks below.
**WHY** — Focusing on one screen reduces cognitive load and keeps you in flow.
**CHECK** — Use the Practice button to answer 3 quick cloze questions.
**DON'T** — Don’t open ten tabs. Stay here; ask the Coach if you’re stuck.

## What makes this calm
- One action at a time: read, ask, or practice.
- Clear typography and spacing you can adjust.
- Narration available via the top bar.
- The Coach only uses content from this page when answering.

## Ask the Coach
Type a question in the Coach panel. It will answer using ONLY the content on this page.
If you add an `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env`, the Coach becomes generative but still grounded.
Without a key, it returns a relevant snippet from this lesson (offline mode).

## Practice that sticks
Click **Practice** to try three cloze prompts generated from this page.
